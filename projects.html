                <p>Hello! I am Jenny Hopkins, a computer science Master’s student and administrator at Boston University. I recently completed a Bachelor’s Certificate in Computer Science. I am curious about learning all aspects of software engineering.
                I have a Master’s degree in Higher Education from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Chinese from Wellesley College. Previously, I have worked at Wharton, Wellesley College, and as an ESL teacher in France. In my free time, I enjoy singing, hiking, and learning new languages. 
                
                <br><br>On this website, you can explore some photos I've taken on my travels, computer science projects (still under construction), and a page to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!
                
                <br><br>Jenny</p>
