        <p>Hello! I am Jenny Hopkins, a computer science Master’s student and administrator at Boston University. I
            recently completed a Bachelor’s Certificate in Computer Science. I am curious about learning all aspects of
            software engineering.
            I have a Master’s degree in Higher Education from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of
            Education
            and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Chinese from Wellesley College. Previously, I have worked at
            Wharton,
            Wellesley College, and as an ESL teacher in France. In my free time, I enjoy singing, hiking, and learning
            new
            languages.

            <br><br>On this website, you can explore some <a href="photos_page.html" target="_blank">photos I've taken
                on my travels</a>, <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">computer science projects</a> (still
            a work in progress), and a <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">page to contact me</a>. I look forward to
            hearing from you!

            <br><br>Jenny
        </p>
